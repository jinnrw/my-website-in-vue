# my-website-in-vue

My personal website [jinnwang-site.web.app](https://jinnwang-site.web.app/) was built in Vue and content stored in Firebase.  

I was trully inspired from this Medium article ([How I built a Content Management System for a React app in one day](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-built-a-content-management-system-for-a-react-app-in-one-day-269df17f5509)), so I decided to build myself a small CMS to manage the site content, see [here](https://github.com/jinnrw/my-personal-site-cms) for more info.
